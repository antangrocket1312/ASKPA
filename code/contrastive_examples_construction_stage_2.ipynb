The rates are normally very fair and as a platinum SPG member, I was given a room on the club floor with a nice view of the city.\\n\\nThe lounge is pretty bad IMO.  The waiters expect you to tip and they charge for soda.  The food selection is good but nothing special.  Yes the lounge has a great view and is well designed but what lounge expects you to tip.  I've stayed at Marriotts and Starwood hotels all around the world and have never felt the pressure to tip as I did here.  \n",
       "        1        Been staying at this hotel for years now and still enjoy the place.  It was renovated a few years ago and has a great location.  The rates are normally very fair and as a platinum SPG member, I was given a room on the club floor with a nice view of the city.\\n\\nThe lounge is pretty bad IMO.  The waiters expect you to tip and they charge for soda.  The food selection is good but nothing special.  Yes the lounge has a great view and is well designed but what lounge expects you to tip.
