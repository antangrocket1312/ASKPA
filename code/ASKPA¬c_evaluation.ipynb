       "1035123 4  This restaurant is housed in the old 1916 Mt. Horub Creamery building. The interior was modern and clean.  Clean is paramount to getting five stars from me.  The food exceeded my expectations for what I call \"bar-food\".  I ordered their homemade Grumpy Troll Root Beer. I wasn't fond of it.  It was quite a strong root beer flavor and a bit sweet,  but what do I know? I'm not a pop drinker.  The Erik the Red Brat was fabulous, as was the Sweet Potato Tots served extra crispy,  at my request, and their housemade chipotle ranch dipping sauce! I would go here again just for that perfect brat!   \n",
